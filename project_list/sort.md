# Sorting program

- All my document/images are disorganized, and I want them organized with a correct name. It's hazardeous to open every 5000 images/video, so the program will show a preview of every document/images scanned, then we can decide (either by template or personally made) the new name/dict path

- We also need a feature to delete some of them (maybe the image is too useless).
