## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a student, trying to learn anything about computer and maybe getting a job there ðŸ˜ŠðŸ‘Œ

My "Endgame" projects :
  ## - 3D Voxel game (similar to Minecraft or Space Engineers)
  ## - Creating a barebone CPU (waiting for materials and documentation on RISC-V)
  ## - Login Authenticator (with Python)
