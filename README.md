# Hi there, Hamza G.ðŸ‘‹

I am a student (Polytechnique MontrÃ©al), trying to learn anything about computer and developping my own skills ðŸ˜ŠðŸ‘Œ

## Coding

These are the languages I learned :
![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3670A0?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=ffdd54)

These are the languages I'm learning :
![C](https://img.shields.io/badge/c-%2300599C.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=c&logoColor=white)
![C++](https://img.shields.io/badge/c++-%2300599C.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=c%2B%2B&logoColor=white)

## **BIG** Projects

This is the list of projects I'm actively doing :

- Small AI project with Python (Learning while developping it)
- Automating file sorting with all the images/video/documents I have
- Minecraft Clone (probably with C or C++)
- Drone Project
- Finance Management System (knowing the ins and outs of my bank account)

These are potential ideas I don't wanna lose, so I will do in the far future :

- Creating a telescope syncronised with any phone (Probably with Python if I'm capable of embedding it in a phone)
- Building a functionning RISC-V Computer (from CPU to the OS)
- Combining the Finance Management System with AI to play with the market/stocks
