# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a student, trying to learn anything about computer and maybe getting a job there ðŸ˜ŠðŸ‘Œ

## Coding
My main language is **Python** (v3)

I'm also trying to learn C (for learning purpose), so that I can learn C++ and Rust

If I have extra time, **ASM** will be included [But not x86 ASM first, it will be RISC-V ASM]

## **BIG** Projects
### I have a dream âœ¨
I want to programs many things, but I need the starting blocks beforehand. I'm also indecisive, so I don't even know what to start first between...

- Coding a compiler for my class's pseudocode (It's too inconcise with the teacher ðŸ’€)
- Building a functionning RISC-V Computer (from CPU to the OS)
- Creating a telescope syncronised with any phone (Probably with Python if I'm capable of embedding it in a phone)
- Automating file sorting with all the images/video/documents I have
- Creating a Minecraft Clone
- Playing with AI (probably with TensorFlow or PyTorch)
- Automating Physics and Chemistry Labs (Excel) ðŸ˜Š
- A cute drone
- My entire Budget history and planning (With Python/Excel [if automated] and/or Notion)
- Application where I can list in order my projects (very easy, with Notion or Microsoft ToDo), but syncronise between them

## My futue objectives
### If I want to complete these dreams, I need at least to upgrade part of my setup to accomodate to it and/or do some things.

1. I will need a computer with a strong GPU (Done)
2. I will need a working desk for electronics stuff / soldering / 3D printing (I need money ðŸ˜­)
3. I will need to setup correctly VSCode/Jetbrains IDE (I'm a little bit dumb ðŸ«¢)
4. I will need to learn with some tutorials (I'm locked in the Tutorial Hell ðŸ”¥ðŸ’€ðŸ”¥)
5. I will need to program / create some of these projects (I'm a little bit lazy ðŸ˜”)
6. I will need some materials for some of these projects
